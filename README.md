3. Restart Chrome
4. The first time you use the extension, Chrome will download the AI model (~1.5GB)

## üìñ Usage

1. **Navigate to a LeetCode problem**

    ```
    https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
    ```

2. **Click the Code Compass extension icon**

    - The side panel will open on the right

3. **Ask for help**
    - Type "Summarize" to get a problem summary
    - Type "Generate a Hints" to get conceptual hints
    - Type custom questions for future features

### Development Workflow

**For UI development:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

View at `http://localhost:5173` with mock Chrome APIs

**For extension testing:**

```bash
npm run build -- --watch
```

Then reload the extension in Chrome after changes

## üîß Configuration

### Allowed Origins

By default, Code Compass only works on LeetCode problem pages. Modify in `App.jsx`:

```javascript
const allowedOrigins = ["https://leetcode.com/problems/"];
```

## üìù Scripts

| Command                    | Description                               |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`              | Start Vite dev server (UI development)    |
| `npm run build`            | Build production extension                |
| `npm run build -- --watch` | Build in watch mode (recommended for dev) |
| `npm run preview`          | Preview production build                  |

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Could not establish connection" error

**Solution:** Reload the LeetCode page after installing/updating the extension

### "Summarizer API not available"

**Solution:**

1. Enable Chrome AI flags (see Enable Chrome AI APIs section)
2. Restart Chrome
3. Wait for model download on first use

### Extension not loading

**Solution:**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note**: Code Compass is designed to help you **learn**, not to provide solutions. It follows the Socratic method - guiding you to discover answers yourself. If you're looking for direct code solutions, this tool isn't for you!

**Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è for learners who want to truly understand algorithms**
